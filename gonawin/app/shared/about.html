    <h2><small>A social web application to make "friendly bets" on sports events.</small></h2>
    <p>We believe that today's betting platforms are full of ads that polute the game itself. We want to create a platform that people can use to bet/play with their friends and family or anyone they want, without any ads and without asking for any money.</p>
    <h3>The code:</h3>
    <p>You can find the code of this web app in github.com <a href="http://www.github.com/santiaago/gonawin">here</a> as well as the description of how we built it and the stack of technologies that we used.</p>
    <h3>The why behind the Y:</h3>

    <p>We, <a href="https://twitter.com/santiago_arias">Santiago</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/rjourde">Remy</a>, built this project from scratch without really knowing how it would turn out but with the will to learn something new. And we did. <br><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+CarmenRebolledo/">Carmen</a> helped us a lot with the design of the app, the logo and character (bidulio) and giving us her opinion concerning the usability and design of the app.</p>
    <p>We hope you enjoy playing as much as we enjoyed making it.</p>
